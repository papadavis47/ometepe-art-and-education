The founders of OAE are from Nicaragua. They teach Nicaraguan dance and culinary arts - as well as
provide summer camps for children in the Seattle/Tacoma area - where they teach Spanish and Central
American culture.

The website utilizes the useContext API from React.js - to allow for bilingual (Spanish/English)
transitions by clicking a button on the Navbar.

There are links to a contact form as well as a navbar link to register for camps provided by OAE.
